Segment Operating Results  As announced on April 20, 2023, we brought together part of Google Research (the Brain team) and DeepMind to significantly accelerate our progress in artificial intelligence (AI). The group, called Google DeepMind, is reported within Alphabet's unallocated corporate costs prospectively beginning in the second quarter of 2023. Previously, the Brain team was included within Google Services.  Quarter Ended September 30,  2022   2023  (recast)  Operating income (loss): Google Services   $   18,883   $   23,937 Google Cloud   (440)   266 Other Bets   (1,225)   (1,194) Corporate costs, unallocated (1)   (83)   (1,666) Total income from operations   $   17,135   $   21,343  (1)   In addition to the Alphabet-level costs included in unallocated corporate costs, hedging gains (losses) related to revenue were $638 million and $(1) million for the three months ended September 30, 2022 and 2023, respectively.  2
Additional Information Relating to the Quarter Ended September 30, 2023   (unaudited)  Reductions in Our Workforce and Office Space  In January 2023, we announced a reduction of our workforce, and as a result we recorded employee severance and related charges of $86 million and $2.1 billion for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. In addition, we are taking actions to optimize our global office space. As a result, exit charges recorded during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 were $16 million and $649 million, respectively. In addition to these exit charges, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, we incurred $207 million in accelerated rent and accelerated depreciation. We may incur additional charges in the future as we further evaluate our real estate needs. For segment reporting, the substantial majority of these charges are included within unallocated corporate costs in our segment results.  Change in Useful Lives of Our Server and Network Equipment  In January 2023, we completed an assessment of the useful lives of our servers and network equipment and adjusted the estimated useful life of our servers from four years to six years and the estimated useful life of certain network equipment from five years to six years. This change in accounting estimate was effective beginning in fiscal year 2023, and the effect was a reduction in depreciation expense of $977 million and $2.9 billion and an increase in net income of $761 million and $2.3 billion, or $0.06 and $0.18 per basic and $0.06 and $0.18 per diluted share for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively.

We undertake no duty to update this information unless required by law.  About Non-GAAP Financial Measures  To supplement our consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP, we use the following non-GAAP financial measures: free cash flow; constant currency revenues; and percentage change   in   constant   currency   revenues. The   presentation   of   this   financial   information   is   not   intended   to   be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. We use these non-GAAP financial measures for financial and operational decision-making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our performance and liquidity by excluding certain items that may not be indicative of our recurring core business operating results, such as our revenues excluding the effect of foreign 3
exchange rate movements and hedging activities, which are recognized at the consolidated level. We believe that both management and investors benefit from referring to these non-GAAP financial measures in assessing our performance and when planning, forecasting, and analyzing future periods. These non-GAAP financial measures also facilitate management’s internal comparisons to our historical performance and liquidity as well as comparisons to our competitors’ operating results. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors both because (1) they allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in its financial and operational decision-making and (2) they are used by our institutional investors and the analyst community to help them analyze the health of our business. There are a number of limitations related to the use of non-GAAP financial measures. We compensate for these limitations by providing specific information regarding the GAAP amounts excluded from these non-GAAP financial measures and evaluating these non-GAAP financial measures together with their relevant financial measures in accordance with GAAP. For more information on these non-GAAP financial measures, please see the tables captioned “Reconciliation from net cash provided by operating activities to free cash flow” and “Reconciliation from GAAP revenues to non-GAAP constant currency revenues and GAAP percentage change in revenues to non-GAAP percentage change in constant currency revenues” included at the end of this release.

Google Services generates revenues primarily from advertising; sales of apps and in-app purchases, and hardware; and fees received for subscription-based products such as YouTube Premium and YouTube TV. •   Google Cloud includes infrastructure and platform services, collaboration tools, and other services for enterprise customers. Google Cloud generates revenues from fees received for Google Cloud Platform services, Google Workspace communication and collaboration tools, and other enterprise services. •   Other Bets is a combination of multiple operating segments that are not individually material. Revenues from Other Bets are generated primarily from the sale of health technology and internet services. Certain costs are not allocated to our segments because they represent Alphabet-level activities. These costs primarily   include AI-focused   shared   R&D   activities;   corporate   initiatives   such   as   our   philanthropic   activities; corporate shared costs such as certain finance, human resource, and legal costs, including certain fines and settlements. Charges associated with reductions in our workforce and office space announced in January 2023 are not allocated to our segments. Additionally, hedging gains (losses) related to revenue are not allocated to our segments. 8
Other Income (Expense), Net  The following table presents our other income (expense), net (in millions; unaudited):  Quarter Ended September 30,  2022   2023  Interest income   $   615   $   1,066 Interest expense   (101)   (116) Foreign currency exchange gain (loss), net   (136)   (311) Gain (loss) on debt securities, net   (731)   (503) Gain (loss) on equity securities, net (1)   (647)   (366) Performance fees   54   179 Income (loss) and impairment from equity method investments, net   (99)   (215) Other   143   120 Other income (expense), net   $   (902)   $   (146)  (1)   Includes all gains and losses, unrealized and realized, on equity securities. For Q3 2023, the net effect of the loss on equity securities of $366 million and the $179 million of performance fees related to certain investments decreased the provision for income tax, net income, and diluted EPS by $39 million, $148 million, and $0.01, respectively. Fluctuations in the value of our investments may be affected by market dynamics and other factors and could significantly contribute to the volatility of OI&E in future periods.  Reconciliation from Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities to Free Cash Flow   (in millions; unaudited) :  We provide free cash flow because it is a liquidity measure that provides useful information to management and investors about the amount of cash generated by the business that can be used for strategic opportunities, including investing in our business and acquisitions, and to strengthen our balance sheet.  Quarter Ended September 30, 2023  Net cash provided by operating activities   $   30,656 Less: purchases of property and equipment   (8,055)  Free cash flow   $   22,601  Free cash flow:   We define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures.  9
Reconciliation from GAAP Revenues to Non-GAAP Constant Currency Revenues and GAAP Percentage Change in Revenues to Non-GAAP Percentage Change in Constant Currency Revenues   (in millions, except percentages; unaudited) :  We provide non-GAAP constant currency revenues (“constant currency revenues”) and non-GAAP percentage change in constant currency revenues (“percentage change in constant currency revenues”), because they facilitate the comparison of current results to historic performance by excluding the effect of foreign exchange rate movements (“FX Effect”) as well as hedging activities, which are recognized at the consolidated level, as they are not indicative of our core operating results. Non-GAAP   constant   currency   revenues   is   defined   as   revenues   excluding   the   effect   of   foreign   exchange   rate movements and hedging activities and is calculated by translating current period revenues using prior period exchange rates and excluding any hedging effect recognized in the current period.
